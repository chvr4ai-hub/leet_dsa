# FRONTEND_PERFORMANCE

## Frontend Performance
Reduce time to interactive and perceived latency.

**Real-time example (product page):**
Serve images from a CDN and defer non-critical JS so the page loads quickly on mobile.

**Notes:**
- Optimize the critical rendering path.
- Use caching headers and CDNs.
- Lazy-load heavy resources.
