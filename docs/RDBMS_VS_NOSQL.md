# RDBMS_VS_NOSQL

## RDBMS vs NoSQL
Choose between relational and non-relational databases based on access patterns.

**Real-time example (transactions vs sessions):**
Use an RDBMS for financial transactions, and a key-value store for user session data.

**Notes:**
- RDBMS: structured schema, strong consistency, rich queries.
- NoSQL: flexible schema, horizontal scaling, simpler queries.
- Data model should match query patterns.
