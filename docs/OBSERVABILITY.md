# OBSERVABILITY

## Observability
Understand system behavior through logs, metrics, and traces.

**Real-time example (slow checkout):**
Traces show a spike in DB latency for the payment query, explaining higher checkout times.

**Notes:**
- Logs: detailed events.
- Metrics: numeric trends over time.
- Traces: request flow across services.
- Golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, saturation.
