# SLA_SLO_SLI

## SLA, SLO, and SLI
Define and measure reliability targets.

**Real-time example (API uptime):**
An API has an SLO of 99.9% monthly availability and an SLA that offers credits if it falls below that.

**Notes:**
- SLI: the measured metric (latency, error rate, uptime).
- SLO: target for the SLI.
- SLA: contractual promise tied to business impact.
- Error budgets help balance reliability and feature velocity.
